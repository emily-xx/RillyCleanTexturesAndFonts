Copy these files directly into World of Warcraft's _retail_ folder.

You do not need the Fonts to use the textures, so only use them if you like.

Thanks to MiirGUI for providing inspiration with its Unit frame skin that is still used today! This is all that remains, but it is quite lovely and simple. :)
